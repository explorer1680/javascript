arrow function get 'this' when it created.
when defined in object:
    {
        a: 'a'
        f: ()=>{
            this means windows
        }
    }

when defined in class:
    class C {
        m = () =>{
            this means this instance of C
        }
    }

when defined in function:
    var P = function(...){
        this.f = ()=>{
            this means the object.
        }
    }

when defined in prototype:
    p.prototype.f=() =>{
        this means windows
    }

please note, in the above situation, if we use:
f = function(){
    ()=>{...}
}
the result may different.

syntax:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

one param, simple expression, parentheses is not needed, return is implied;
    param => expression

Multiple params require parentheses:
    (param1, paramN) => expression

Multiline statements require body brackets and return:
    param => {
        ...
        return ...;
    }

To return an object literal expression requires parentheses around expression:
    params => ({foo: "a"}) // returning the object {foo: "a"}
