ES6 support javascript module.
but, this feature are not supported by modern browser. you have to use webpack to bundle them to 1 js file to let them work.


module is just a normal .js file, but, it can export and import.

export default 'xxx';
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
ex

import string from './xxx/name';

import
