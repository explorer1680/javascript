ES6 support javascript module.
but, this feature are not supported by modern browser. you have to use webpack to bundle them to 1 js file to let them work.


module is just a normal .js file, but, it can export and import.

export default 'xxx';
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;


import string from './xxx/name';

to look at the result, please see the example in src and dist.

you need add 'type="module"' to both <script>

to run this exmple, you have to use httpd:
docker container run -d --rm --name httpd -p 80:80 -v /Users/Ethan/git/javascript/es6/module/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
