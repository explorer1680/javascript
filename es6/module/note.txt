ES6 support javascript module.
but, this feature are not supported by modern browser. you have to use webpack to bundle them to 1 js file to let them work.


module is just a normal .js file, but, it can export and import.

export default 'xxx';
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

export have to be used when declare the variable.
    you can't declare it first, and export it later.
export default can separate declearation and export.
only one 'export default' can exist in on module.
you can have multiple export and only one 'export default'.

when using import,
    import {xxx, yyy, zzz} from ...
        is to imporing normal export, the name has to be match.
    import abc from ...
        is to importig 'export default', the name can be any name.
    


import string from './xxx/name';

to look at the result, please see the example in src and dist.

you need add 'type="module"' to both <script>

to run this exmple, you have to use httpd:
docker container run -d --rm --name httpd -p 80:80 -v /Users/Ethan/git/javascript/es6/module/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
