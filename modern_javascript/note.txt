Babel:
is a javascript compiler.
translate ES6/ESNext to ES5.
polyfill: when ES6 translate to ES5, some of the feature of ES6 that ES5 don't have, it is no way to convert them directly to ES5.
We have to mimic the function of these feature in ES5, it is call 'polyfill'. 
(we write some code in ES5 to implements these functions.)
For example, "Promise" object or Array.from, ES5 don't have thess object.

ES6 Module bundler: webpack, it will bundle all files into 1 .js file, 1 .css file, and image files: .jpg files, and .png files.

npm(node package manager) put all these together.

npm command:
npm init: to create a package.json file.
npm install webpack --save-dev: 'save-dev' means it will save webpack as a development dependancy of our project.
it will add 'webpack' in the package.json under the "devDependencies".
npm install jquery --save: it will add 'jquery' in the package.json usner the "dependancies".

node_modules contains all the dependancies defined in package.json and the dependancies of them(dependancies of webpack and jquery).

to share the project with others, we only need share the package.json file, and run:
npm install
all the file will be installed in the node_modules dir.

npm uninstall jquery --save: it will uninstall jquery from "dependancies"
npm install live-server --global: it will save the package globally, which means all projects in this machine can access it.
--save or --save-dev are locally accessible, only this project can use it.
